     Names here used to refer Service.json actions in 4 different ways:
     - action names in your code, such as TwitterAction.currentUser.perform()
     - action names in your storyboard or json files. It's just a string, such as "currentUser"
     - notifications of action status in you code, such as TwitterAction.currentUser.notification.onSuccess.subscribe {...}
     - notifications in your storyboard or json files, you must use it with notification suffix, such as "currentUserSuccess" or "currentUserError"
       See NetworkRequestStatusProtocol for possible values.
       For example:
         BaseContentController.reloadOn = "currentUserSuccess" (storyboard/json variant),
         BaseContentController.reloadOn = TwitterAction.currentUser.notification.onSuccess.rawValue (code type safe variant).
     
     You are not obligated to create these cases, it's only for convinience in your custom code. For example there is no "logout" case, because it's not used
     directly in the code, but there is custom action for this in TwitterActions class (see below).
